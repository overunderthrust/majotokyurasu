  "description": "Akira, a young yakitori shop owner, has fallen in love with Houka, a bunny girl who often eats at his restaurant. But how can he get close to her when he has to focus on the grill‽ And there are 4 other bunny girls that look just like her‽\n\nNote: “Piccolina” is short for “Picco di Stellina”, which means “Starlet Peak” or “Peak of the Starlet” in Italian.",
